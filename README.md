# moneyGuru

This package contains the source for moneyGuru. Its documentation is
[available online][documentation]. Here's how this source tree is organised:

* core: Contains the core logic code for moneyGuru. It's Python code.
* cocoa: UI code for the Cocoa toolkit. It's Objective-C code.
* qt: UI code for the Qt toolkit. It's written in Python and uses PyQt.
* images: Images used by the different UI codebases.
* debian: Skeleton files required to create a .deb package.
* help: Help document, written for Sphinx.
* locale: .po files for localisation.

There are also other sub-folder that comes from external repositories and are part of this repo as
git subtrees:

* hscommon: A collection of helpers used across HS applications.
* cocoalib: A collection of helpers used across Cocoa UI codebases of HS applications.
* qtlib: A collection of helpers used across Qt UI codebases of HS applications.
* ambuttonbar: Cocoa library to display filter buttons.
* psmtabbarcontrol: Cocoa library for tabs.

# How to build moneyGuru from source

## Prerequisites installation

Then, you have to make sure that your system has its "non-pip-installable" prerequisites installed:

* All systems: [Python 3.2+][python] and [distribute][distribute]
* Mac OS X: The last XCode to have the 10.6 SDK included.
* Windows: Visual Studio 2008, [PyQt 4.7+][pyqt], [cx_Freeze][cxfreeze] and
  [Advanced Installer][advinst] (you only need the last two if you want to create an installer)

On Ubuntu, the apt-get command to install all pre-requisites is:

    $ apt-get install python3-dev python3-pyqt4 pyqt4-dev-tools python3-setuptools

## Virtualenv setup

First, you need `pip` and `virtualenv` in your system Python install:

    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

Then, in moneyGuru's source folder, create a virtual environment and activate it:

    $ virtualenv --system-site-packages env
    $ source env/bin/activate

(`--system-site-packages` is only required for PyQt and cx_Freeze, so it's not needed on Mac OS X)

Then, you can install pip requirements in your virtualenv:

    $ pip install -r requirements-[osx|win].txt
    
([osx|win] depends, of course, on your platform. On other platforms, just use requirements.txt).

**Temporary problem:** The author of polib, which is a dependency here,
[hasn't yet uploaded packages to PyPI][polib], which will make the command fail if you use
pip >= 1.5. You'll have to add `--allow-external polib --allow-unverified polib` to your command.
This is, hopefully, a temporary situation.

## Alternative: pyvenv

If you're on Python 3.3+, you can use the built-in `pyvenv` instead of `virtualenv`. `pyvenv` is
pretty much the same thing as `virtualenv`, except that it doesn't install distribute and pip, so it
has to be installed manually:

    $ pyvenv --system-site-packages env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
    $ python distribute_setup.py
    $ easy_install pip

## Actual building and running

With your virtualenv activated, you can build and run moneyGuru with these commands:

    $ python configure.py
    $ python build.py
    $ python run.py

You can also package moneyGuru into an installable package with:
    
    $ python package.py
