moneyGuru API
=============================================

This part of the documentation describes classes seen in moneyGuru's code, every class being described individually. If you haven't already, you might want to read the :doc:`overview of moneyGuru's architecture <../architecture>`. This documentation is not complete and only include core elements of the API. The reason for this is that moneyGuru's code evolves fairly quickly and keeping up with every little details of the API is not worth it, IMO. However, with this documentation, it should normally be possible for someone new to the code to dig in it and figure out, from the code, what everything is about.
